# Server Monitoring App


The Server Monitoring App is a web-based application that allows users to monitor various metrics of their servers in real-time. This application provides insights into server performance, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and system information. The app consists of a backend API built with Express.js and a frontend interface developed with React.

## Features

- **Real-time Metrics:** The app fetches and displays real-time metrics from the server, providing up-to-date information on CPU cores, CPU usage, and memory status.

- **System Information:** Users can access detailed system information, including OS version, hostname, kernel details, and more, through the API.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The frontend is designed using React, providing a responsive and intuitive interface for users to easily navigate and understand the server metrics.
